# 9. Testing and debugging

## Tools

**SignalsEverywhere's mod tab** (in the game's mod settings):

| Button | Does |
|---|---|
| Reload Signal Definitions | Re-reads every `signals` file and rebuilds. |
| Dump Signals | Writes `signal-old.json` and `signal-patched.json` to SignalsEverywhere's folder. |
| Rebuild CTCPanel | Re-reads every `ctcPanel` file and redraws the panel. |
| Dump CTCPanel | Writes `panel-dump.json`. |
| Blocks (dropdown) | Highlights the chosen block's track on the map. |

**Console commands** (host only):

- `/signaldebug dump signals`: same as Dump Signals.
- `/signaldebug dump panel`: same as Dump CTCPanel.

**Files** in SignalsEverywhere's mod folder:

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `signal-old.json` | The game's signals before any mod. Your source of real ids and locations. |
| `signal-patched.json` | After every mod's patches. Shows what SignalsEverywhere **meant** to build. |
| `panel-dump.json` | The merged panel layout. |
| `ctcpanel-failed.json` | Written when the panel layout can't be read at all. |

**Logs**: SignalsEverywhere logs patch errors ("Error loading mixinto …"), missing ids ("Block with ID 'x' not found in patching context") and what it created. Under RailForge, also read the `## Signal authoring` section of `Mods/RTM.RailForge/RailForge-support-report.txt` (see [RailForge](08-railforge.md)).

## Patched data is not proof

`signal-patched.json` shows the result of the merge. Whether that reached the game depends on what counted as touched (see [What gets rebuilt](07-patching.md#what-gets-rebuilt)) and on RailForge's checks. A change can be in the patched data and still not be in the game. Always confirm on the railroad: the panel, the signals, and a train.

## A test run

For every control point you add or change:

1. **Blocks**: highlight each new block in the mod tab. Then run a train through: each block light on the panel should come on as the train enters and go off when the last car leaves.
2. **Each route, each direction (CTC)**: code the route, check the right signal clears and the others stay at Stop. Check the aspect: Clear or Approach on the normal route, Diverging on the diverging one.
3. **Next signal**: with the next signal at Stop, a signal should show Approach. With it clear, Clear. A signal that never shows Clear has a missing or stale next signal.
4. **Opposing moves**: set a route one way, then try to code the opposite direction at the next control point. It should refuse.
5. **Occupancy**: put a car on the OS block. Every signal at that control point should go to Stop, and the switches shouldn't move.
6. **Hand-thrown switch**: unlock a switch in CTC or throw one in ABS. Its block should show occupied.
7. **ABS**: switch the railroad to ABS and repeat the basic moves. Predicate signals are where ABS surprises happen.
8. **Auto engineer**: send an AE train through on Road mode both ways. It should obey every aspect without stopping where it shouldn't.
9. **Reload the save** and check the routes and directions came back.

## Symptoms and causes

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| None of the mod's changes appear. | One broken instruction stopped the whole file. Check the log for "Error loading mixinto". |
| One module's changes are missing under RailForge. | RailForge deferred it. Read `## Signal authoring` in the support report. |
| The change is in `signal-patched.json` but not in the game. | An array item edit (`$find`/`$index`/`$add`) that didn't count as a touch. Add a harmless `$replace` to the same component. |
| A signal is stuck at Approach and never shows Clear. | Its next signal is `null`, or points at a signal that was rebuilt (a stale reference). Touch the control point or predicate signal that names it. |
| A control point's lever does nothing ("no route"). | No route matches the current switch positions, or `switchFilters` don't line up with `switchSets`. |
| A control point vanished after a patch (plain Railloader). | You patched its module without touching its interlocking/intermediate. |
| A block never shows occupied. | A span's ends don't connect along the track. Try measuring one end from the other end of its segment. |
| A block shows occupied with no train. | It overlaps a hand-thrown switch, or another train's block. Check with the Blocks highlight. |
| A signal faces the wrong way. | Its location is measured from the wrong end. |
| A signal stands on the wrong side or in the track. | `leftSide` or `offset`. |
| A signal clears for the wrong direction. | Its `direction`, or the outlet direction in the interlocking. |
| A control point signal never clears, with an error about an empty `interlockingRouteMapping`. | The auto signal is missing its route mapping. |
| Intermediate signals stay red after the train has passed, or clear against a route. | The intermediate's block or signal order isn't left to right, or its `signalLeft`/`signalRight` don't match the control points. |
| The panel won't open. | The panel layout couldn't be read; see `ctcpanel-failed.json` and the log. |
| Levers overlap on the panel. | Columns too close together. See [How X works](06-ctc-panel.md#how-x-works). |
